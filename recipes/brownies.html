            Brownies are a popular baked dessert characterized by their rich, 
            chocolatey flavor and dense, fudgy or cakey texture. Typically made 
            from ingredients like melted chocolate, cocoa powder, butter, sugar, 
            eggs, and flour, brownies can also include mix-ins such as nuts, 
            chocolate chips, or swirls of cream cheese or caramel. 
            They are often baked in a rectangular or square pan and cut 
            into squares or rectangles for serving. The result is a decadent 
            treat that can be enjoyed on its own or paired with ice cream, 
            whipped cream, or a glass of milk.
