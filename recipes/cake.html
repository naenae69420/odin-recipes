            Cake is a sweet, baked dessert that is typically light, fluffy, and 
            moist. Made from a mixture of flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil, and
             a leavening agent like baking powder or baking soda, cakes can be 
             flavored with a variety of ingredients such as vanilla, chocolate, 
             fruit, or spices. The batter is poured into a mold and baked until 
             it rises and sets. Cakes are often layered and filled or topped with
              frosting, icing, or ganache and can be decorated with fruits, nuts, 
              or sprinkles. They are enjoyed on special occasions like birthdays, 
              weddings, and holidays, but can also be a delightful treat for any day.
