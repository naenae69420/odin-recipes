            Pho is a traditional Vietnamese soup consisting of broth,
            rice noodles, herbs, and meat, typically beef or chicken.
            The flavorful broth, simmered for hours with spices like 
            star anise, cloves, and cinnamon, forms the base of the dish. 
            Fresh garnishes such as bean sprouts, basil, lime, and chili 
            peppers are added to taste, creating a balanced, aromatic, 
            and hearty meal that is enjoyed as a staple in Vietnamese cuisine.
